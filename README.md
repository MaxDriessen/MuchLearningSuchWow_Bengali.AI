### Team MuchLearningSuchWow

This git repository contains all of the code we wrote for the Bengali.AI competition, for the Machine Learning in Practice course. The "Convolutional" folder contains code for the part of our experiment where we investigated the effects of different training methods on the performance of a convolutional model, and the "Ensemble" folder contains code for the part where we tested an ensamble of four different models (ResNeXt, ResNet-56, ResNet-38, CNN).
